# MYSIZE

## Description

Duration: 2-week sprint

MYSIZE is an application that allows you to save your clothing sizes for specific clothing brands. MYSIZE also allows you follow other users on the app and see their favorite clothing brands and sizes.

MYSIZE seeks to eliminate any grey area that is involved in both buying clothes online for yourself, and when trying to give that perfect gift to someone you care about.
